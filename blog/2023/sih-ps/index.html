With the rise of transcriptional and translational facilities, several traditional medicinal texts are now available in their digitized forms. But for an Ayurvedic student or practitioner, exploring this multitude of literature for identifying their ““drug of choice’ often becomes tedious and impractical. Here is the need of a custom software that can identify the apt formulation that has been designed to treat a constellation of symptoms and present it to the student/practitioner along with its reference and other desired properties. For example, the two formulations Punarnavadi Kashaya and Vyaghryadi Kashaya are mentioned in texts as follows: Both these are decoctions advised in Jvara (fever) and Kasa (cough). But in a patient with upper respiratory tract infections like common cold (Pinasa), Vyaghryadi would suit better than Punarnavadi. Whereas in a condition associated with inflammatory changes all over the body. I Punarnavadi would be the appropriate choice. The objective of the proposed software is to identify the single drugs and formulations that suit a set of symptoms. Certain ingredients (eg. jaggery) are unsuitable for certain categories of patients (e.g. diabetics). There are also medicine mediums that are unsuitable for specific diseases (e.g. fermented/alcoholic preparations in diabetes). Such information is also expected to be conveyed to the learner or practitioner who uses the software. The same disease has been mentioned in different names (E.g. Jvara and Santapa for fever) and the same word has been used to denote different (Eg. Abhaya generally means Terminalia chebula but in the context of Jatyadi ghrita, it means Vetiveria zizanioides. The multiple names of same diseases are expected to be included in the tags of each formulation. The sources for the formulations, and synonyms and similar words have been included in the data section. It is also desirable to include the Ayurvedic pharmacological properties of the single drugs, and the compound formulation (called Rasa, Guna, Virya, Vipaka, etc.) as and where available. <h3 id="sih1383---optimizing-doctor-availability-and-appointment-allocation-in-hospitals-through-digital-technology-and-al-integration">SIH1383 - Optimizing Doctor Availability and Appointment Allocation in Hospitals through Digital Technology and Al Integration.</h3> </li> <li>Organization - Govt. of himachal pradesh To develop a digital system that streamlines the appointment scheduling process in hospitals by automating the process of identifying doctor availability and appointment slot allocation. The system will utilize advanced technologies such as RFID, face detection, proximity of Mobile phone, or any other relevant technology to detect the presence of doctors in the hospital. The system will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to allocate appointment slots based on the doctor’s presence and the number of waitlisted patients. This will improve the overall patient experience by reducing the wait time. In conclusion, the proposed digital system will improve the efficiency and convenience of the appointment scheduling process in hospitals; the patients will benefit with reduced waiting time. <h3 id="sih1343---identification-of-different-medicinal-plantsraw-materials-through-image-processing-using-machine-learning-algorithms">SIH1343 - Identification of Different Medicinal Plants/Raw materials through Image Processing Using Machine Learning Algorithms</h3> </li> <li>Organization : Ministry of Ayush India, with a rich heritage of floral diversity, is well-known for its medicinal plant wealth, but their identification is one of the major burning issues in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics. Several crude drugs are being sold under the same name in the market leading to confusion and their misidentification. Even the collectors and traders are not completely aware of the exact morphological appearance or differentiating attributes of the many drugs owing to seasonal and geographical availability, and similar characteristics. Moreover, the extensive consumption to meet demand-supply ratio exerts a heavy strain on the existing resources. It further leads to the practice of adulteration, substitution, and disbelief in the curative capability of the system eventually. Thus, software capable of identifying different medicinal plants/ raw materials through Image Processing Using Different Machine Learning Algorithms will be of immense use. It will be helpful at every level viz. wholesaler, distributor, etc. of the supply chain of raw material being utilized in the system.</li> </ul> <h2 id="smart-education--sih1283sih1290sih1362sih1369sih1431sih1434">Smart Education : SIH1283**,SIH1290,SIH1362,SIH1369,SIH1431,SIH1434</h2> <h3 id="sih1283---digital-assistant-for-legal-awareness-and-designing-a-kyc-framework-in-india">SIH1283 - Digital Assistant for Legal Awareness and Designing a KYC framework in India</h3> <ul> <li>Organization : Ministry of Law and Justice Access to legal information and awareness is a challenge for a large population in India, especially for those who are not literate or are from marginalized communities. There is a need to provide a user-friendly and easily accessible platform for legal awareness. Challenge: Develop a digital assistant that can provide legal information and guidance to people in a user-friendly manner. The digital assistant should be able to converse in multiple languages and provide information in a concise and easy-to-understand manner. The platform should be accessible through various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. The digital assistant should be able to address common legal queries, such as: 1. What are my rights as a citizen? 2. How can I file a complaint? 3. How can I access legal aid services? 4. How can I obtain legal documents? 5. What are the legal implications of a particular action? The digital assistant should also be able to provide information on various legal topics, such as family law, property law, labor law, and criminal law. Judging criteria: 1.

It functions as an interface between the Government and the media and provides feedback to the Government on peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reactions as reflected in the media. Information is disseminated from Hqrs through Press Releases in English, Hindi, and Urdu and subsequently translated from PIB Regional offices into other Indian languages like Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Odia, Bengali, Assamese, and Manipuri, to reach out to about 8,400 newspapers and media organizations across the country. To provide effective and timely feedback to the Government, an automated feedback system for all the above regional languages using Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning is required. The feedback system should crawl the select regional media sites (around 200 websites) for the news published in regional languages. The software should categorize the stories into the concerned departments as per the tags provided. The stories should be categorized as favorable (positive), neutral, or not favorable (negative) to the Government of India. Negative stories pertaining to a department should be notified to the concerned PIB officer on a real-time basis by SMS or Android notification or by other means. E-papers of select newspapers should be scanned by the system automatically using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The concerned news clippings if it pertains to the Government of India should be cut and electronically pasted in a pre-designed template mentioning the name of the newspaper, the page number where the story was published, the name of the edition, etc. These clippings should be classified into Departments and tonality (positive, negative, and neutral). Also in the dashboard, the title of the newspapers should be displayed and the stories should be in a position to be sorted/filtered using the variables like Tonality, Edition, etc. The system should also crawl through the YouTube channels of select news channels and identify the portion of the news bulletin pertaining to the Government of India using closed captioning. If closed captioning is not available, should use audio to text feature to capture the transcript. Once the portion of the video is identified, the said video has to be categorized into Departments and tonality. If the story is negative, the concerned PIB officer should get the notification immediately. <h2 id="disaster-mangement--sih1417">Disaster Mangement : SIH1417</h2> <h3 id="sih1417---ai-ml-based-intelligent-de-smokingde-hazing-algorithm">SIH1417 - AI-ML based intelligent de-smoking/de-hazing algorithm</h3> </li> <li>Organization - Ministry of Defence Design and Development of AI-ML based intelligent de- smoking/de-hazing algorithm for reproducing the real time video of the area under fire specifically for indoor fire hazards to aid the rescue operation. <h2 id="agriculture-foodtech-and-rural-development--sih1324sih1325">Agriculture foodtech and rural development : SIH1324,SIH1325</h2> <h3 id="sih1324---air-and-water-quality-index-and-environment-monitoring">SIH1324 - Air and water quality index and environment monitoring</h3> </li> <li>Organization: Govt. of Kerala Considering the importance of air and water to human existence, air pollution and water pollution are critical issues that require collective effort for prevention and control.
