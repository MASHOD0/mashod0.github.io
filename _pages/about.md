I am a final year computer science student at Dayandanda Sagar College of Engineering. I am passionate about AI and ML and Software Development and this website should serve as a medium to showcase learnings through my blogs, projects and presentations. I have always been facinated with the impact techology has on our society and wish to work on meaningful projects which have a positive impact on the society.


As the Ex- vice chair of the IEEE robotics and automation club and a founding core member of the technical events club in my department, I organized various workshops, competitions, and seminars. I was also in the organizing committee of our technical fest called Iterations. This involved coordinating with different stakeholders, managing resources, and resolving conflicts I have also lead several hackathon and college projects. Through these experiences, I developed my skills in problem-solving, leadership, and teamwork.
