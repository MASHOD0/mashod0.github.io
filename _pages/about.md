I am a final year computer science student at Dayandanda Sagar College of Engineering. I like AI and ML and Software Development and this website should serve as a medium to showcase my projects and I also share my journey of learning and growing through this blog. I have always been facinated with the impact techology is having on our society and wish to work on meaningful projects which have a positive impact on the society.

I used to be the vice chair of the IEEE robotics and automation club of our college, and a founding core member of the technical events club in the department. I was also in the organizing committee of our departmentâ€™s technical fest called Iterations. I helped organize workshops, competitions, and seminars. I learned a lot about teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving.
